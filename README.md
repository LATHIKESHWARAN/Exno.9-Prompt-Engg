## Aim:
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation
## Algorithm:
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate video content (e.g., animations, visual effects, video summaries) using AI models. Procedure:
Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models:
Begin by exploring AI tools capable of video generation from text prompts. Popular models for video generation include:
Runway Gen-2
Synthesia
Pictory
DeepBrain
Understand the capabilities and limitations of each tool before starting the experiment.
Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation:
Start with simple prompts to generate short videos. These prompts should describe the general subject or activity.
Example prompt: "A person walking in a park."
Experiment with More Detailed Prompts:
Gradually refine your prompts by adding specific details, such as the setting, lighting, actions, or expressions.
Example prompt: "A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them."
Add Time and Motion Elements:
Incorporate aspects like timing, transitions, or camera movement in your prompts.
Example prompt: "A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky."
Test Different Video Styles:
Experiment with different styles of video generation, such as animations, live-action, cinematic, or artistic.
Example prompt: "An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people."
Iterate and Adjust Prompts:
Evaluate the generated video and refine the prompt if needed. Consider aspects like the pacing, transitions, and consistency of motion in the video.
Example: After reviewing, refine the prompt to add more details about the camera angles or actions: "A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene."
Generate Multiple Versions:
Generate multiple versions of the same prompt with slight variations to compare how the video output differs based on the phrasing of the prompt.
Save and Compare Outputs:
Save different versions of the videos and compare the results to understand how different prompts produce varying styles, sequences, and video qualities.

## Prompt
### Tool : Google Veo

Prompt-1 : A cinematic, wide tracking shot gliding over lush green agricultural fields situated in a deep valley surrounded by towering, majestic mountains. A small group of people are walking along a narrow dirt path in the middle distance, interacting naturally with the landscape. Soft, natural daylight with light mist clinging to the mountain peaks. Shot on a 35mm Anamorphic lens to emphasize the scale of the mountains, creating a shallow depth of field. Ultra-realistic textures, organic colors, 8k resolution. Aspect Ratio 2.39:1.

Prompt-2 :  Cinematic low-angle tracking shot of a realistic city street at night, rain-slicked. Diverse crowd of people walking, holding umbrellas. Realistic street lighting, wet pavement reflections, no cyberpunk elements. Shot on 35mm Anamorphic lens, bokeh, lens flares, high contrast, 8k resolution, 2.39:1 aspect ratio.
